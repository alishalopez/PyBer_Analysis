# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of Project
I was tasked with analyzing all rideshare data from January to early May of 2019. Creating clear and concise data and presenting it to the CEO, V. Isualize, is important as my career depends on it. Using a visual chart to sum up my findings will set me apart and convey my findings easier.

## Results
PyBer has 3 different city types to categorize their data, Urban, Suburban, and Rural. Below I have attached an image of their data to provide a better understanding.

It is clear that Urban city types are dominant among the others as they bring in more total fares than Suburban and Rural combined. Due to the high supply of drivers in Urban areas, their average fare per driver is significantly lower. Rural areas have about 3% of the total drivers compared to Urban areas and their average fare per driver is more than 3 times compared to Urban drivers. 

I was able to present a multiple-line chart to my CEO that broke down total fare by city type over the span of January to early May. A legend made it easy to navigate which city type was which and look at fare prices at any given time shown.

## Summary
There is no doubt PyBer has been successful as they are valued at $2.3 billion, but there is always room for improvement. I recommend the following:
*1. Over that time period, there were more drivers than total rides in the Urban area. With the Urban area bringing in the majority of total fares, we may want to invest in advertising in these areas to ensure we keep drivers busy and employed. 
*2. To reduce wait time for rides and increase rider satisfaction and usage, possibly increase drivers in Rural and Suburban cities.
*3. Consider lowering the prices of fares in Rural and Suburban cities to encourage higher usage of PyBer.
